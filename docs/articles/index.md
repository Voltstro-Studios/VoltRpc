Hello, and welcome to the VoltRpc project site!

These docs should hopefully contain the information you need in-order to use VoltRpc.

## What is VoltRpc?

VoltRpc is a [remote procedure call](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_procedure_call) (RPC) library, using it's own custom implementation, which allows VoltRpc to be [fast](benchmarks.md) and easy to use.

This means you can call a C# method on a remote target (such as a separate process) using C# code.

VoltRpc's lowest .NET target is `netstandard2.0`, so you can use any [.NET implementation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/net-standard?tabs=net-standard-2-0#select-net-standard-version) that implements it.

## Why Another RPC library?

VolrRpc has the goal of being easy to use, fast and lightweight. Other RPC libraries usually included A LOT more features, at the cost of being more heavy and slower. If you only need simple solution, VoltRpc will fullfil that need.
